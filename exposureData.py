#Sources: The exposure data and film characteristics were primarily sourced from LearnFilm.com, which provides comprehensive 
# guides on film stocks and exposure techniques. Additional information was gathered from manufacturer datasheets, including 
# those from Kodak, Fujifilm, and Ilford, to ensure accuracy in film speed and exposure latitude details.

#I also referenced exposure guides from well-respected film photography forums and websites such as EMULSIVE and 35mmc, 
# which offer practical insights from experienced film photographers, as well as the Sunny16 rule.
