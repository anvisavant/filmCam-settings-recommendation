# filmCam-settings-recommendation
With a passion for film photography, I developed the Film Photography Exposure Recommender to bridge my technical skills with my creative interests.
This project stems from my experience as the founder of BombayFilm.Co, where I sourced and restored vintage cameras, giving me unique insights into film photography equipment and techniques.
The recommender combines my programming skills in Python and data analysis with my desire to create an impact in the film photography community to solve a practical problem faced by film photography enthusiasts: determining optimal exposure settings.
